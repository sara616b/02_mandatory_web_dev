Hand-in: No hand in anywhere, but you must bring it with you to the exam and you may be asked to show it. Failure to do this, will give you a 00 at the exam.

Feed-back: Last day is the 24th of March at 12.00. After this date, you cannot ask for feed-back.

Everything is a MUST have, there are no optional points.
Create a Single Page App where the user can:
signup (bridge)
login (bridge)
logout (bridge)
tweet with text and an image. The user can tweet only text and may or may not tweet an image
delete tweet
update a tweet
The user can see all its tweets as a control panel
Validate every field

The user can only create a tweet, delete, or update if it is logged
All tweets are shown on a page. No need to be logged to see it

You can use lists and dictionaries to show all tweets and interact with them, but I recommend you use a database like SQLITE or MYSQL
